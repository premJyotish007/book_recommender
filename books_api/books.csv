['George Orwell'],Coming Up for Air,"Volume 7 of The Complete Works of George Orwell Coming Up for Air looks back from the sprawl of thirties housing estates, new arterial roads and the domination of the motor car, to an idealised golden England, largely rural and unmechanised when, in the nostalgia of childhood, it was 'summer. . . always summer'. It looks forward to the destruction wrought by air-raids (though written in 1938-1939, war is expected in 1941) leading to 'The world we're going down into, the kind of hate-world, slogan-world. . the rubber truncheons. . the posters with enormous faces' that will be Nineteen Eighty-Four. Yet, despite its sense of loss and its grim foreboding, Coming Up for Air is a very funny book, with a rich sense of the incongruity of life and people, and it is illuminated by Orwell's wry, sardonic wit in which there is not a little self-parody.",['Insurance agents'],254.0,en,2018-08-30,

['George Orwell'],Burmese Days,"Honest and evocative, George Orwell’s first novel is an examination of the debasing effect of empire on occupied and occupier. Burmese Days focuses on a handful of Englishmen who meet at the European Club to drink whisky and to alleviate the acute and unspoken loneliness of life in 1920s Burma—where Orwell himself served as an imperial policeman—during the waning days of British imperialism. One of the men, James Flory, a timber merchant, has grown soft, clearly comprehending the futility of England’s rule. However, he lacks the fortitude to stand up for his Indian friend, Dr. Veraswami, for admittance into the whites-only club. Without membership and the accompanying prestige that would protect the doctor, the condemning and ill-founded attack by a bitter magistrate might bring an end to everything he has accomplished. Complicating matters, Flory falls unexpectedly in love with a newly arrived English girl, Elizabeth Lackersteen. Can he find the strength to do right not only by his friend, but also by his conscience?",['Fiction'],288.0,en,1974-03-20,3.0

['George Orwell'],Animal Farm,"A beautiful graphic adaptation of George Orwell's timeless and timely allegorical novel. ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" In 1945, George Orwell, called ""the conscience of his generation,"" created an enduring, devastating story of new tyranny replacing old, and power corrupting even the noblest of causes. Today it is all too clear that Orwell's masterpiece is still fiercely relevant wherever cults of personality thrive, truths are twisted by those in power, and freedom is under attack. Now, in this fully authorized edition, the artist Odyr translates the world and message of Animal Farm into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel. Old Major, Napoleon, Squealer, Snowball, Boxer, and all the animals of Animal Farm come to life in this newly envisaged classic. From his individual brushstrokes to the freedom of his page design, Odyr's adaptation seamlessly moves between satire and fable and will appeal to all ages, just as Orwell intended.",['Comics & Graphic Novels'],176.0,en,2019,1.0

['George Woodcock'],The Crystal Spirit,"The author of four truly important novels--The Recognitions in 1955, J R in 1975, Carpenter's Gothic in 1985, and A Frolic of His Own in 1995--William Gaddis is considered by many literary scholars to be one of the most outstanding novelists of the twentieth century, to be spoken of in the same breath as James Joyce, Robert Musil, and Thomas Pynchon. Hints and Guesses: William Gaddis's Fiction of Longing is the first scholarly work to discuss all four Gaddis novels. While not dismissing the inclination of many scholars to view Gaddis's fiction as postmodern, Christopher Knight moves critical response in another direction, toward a discussion of Gaddis's significance as a satirist and social critic. Knight investigates Gaddis's predominant thematic interests, including those of contemporary aesthetics, Flemish painting, forgery, corporate America, Third World politics, and the U.S. legal system. What Knight finds is an author not only acutely sensitive to post-war social realities but also one whose critique carries with it an implied utopian dimension.",['Biography & Autobiography'],249.0,en,2005,

['George Hunsinger'],Disruptive Grace,"Among the studies of Karl Barth's thought, no other work covers, as this one does, the areas of political, doctrinal, and ecumenical theology in single compass. Written by a leading Barth scholar, Disruptive Grace is unique not only for its range of study, depth of insight, and accuracy of presentation, but also for the way it displays the heart as well as the mind of the great Swiss pastor and theologian. Each of the book's three main sections consists of five major essays. Part 1 relates Barth to contemporary issues of social justice, war, and peace. Part 2 covers christology, pneumatology, the Trinity, scriptural interpretation, and the question of universal salvation. Part 3 discusses the Reformed tradition as Barth understood it in relation to Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, modern liberalism, evangelical conservatism, and the postliberal theology of the contemporary Yale school. The book concludes with a meditation on the saving significance of Christ's death, a theme that runs throughout the book. The result of more than twenty-five years of intensive Barth research, this volume provides scholars, teachers, and students with a thorough discussion of the twentieth century's most significant Christian thinker.",['Religion'],375.0,en,2000,4.5

Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism. In the book, Old Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as ""enemies"" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ""Beasts of England"". When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt, driving the drunken, irresponsible farmer Mr Jones, as well as Mrs Jones and the other human caretakers and employees, off the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, ""All animals are equal"".

['George Sher'],A Wild West of the Mind,"Can unexpressed thoughts be morally wrong? Are people subject to moral condemnation not only for their malicious, biased, and cruel actions, but also for their private malice, biased beliefs, and ugly fantasies? Although many would answer ""yes,"" George Sher argues in A Wild West of the Mind that none of the main approaches to morality support this view and that to accept it would be to relinquish an essential aspect of our mental freedom. To preserve that freedom, we must allow our beliefs to follow the evidence wherever it leads and must give our private feelings, attitudes, and fantasies free rein. As so understood, the realm of the purely mental is a morality-free zone, one within which no thoughts or attitudes are either forbidden or required. Even when our beliefs are irrational or repugnant and our desires reflect badly on our character, it is never morally wrong for us to have them. A Wild West of the Mind advances a provocative thesis of normative ethics and offers a powerful defense of freedom of mind. Broad in scope and tightly argued, the book will have much to offer philosophers working in ethics, free will, and epistemology.",['Philosophy'],135.0,en,2021-05-11,
['George Watson'],Heresies and Heretics,"In this enjoyably iconoclastic book, George Watson discusses some of the great heresies of the twentieth century, and the cultural heretics who espoused them, often with surprising results. Watson provides us with examples of 'true', original heretics, many of whom he has met and taught: from Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, who asserted that his study of the remote past had made a radical of him, rather than any influence of modernism, to Douglas Adams, whom Watson knew as an undergraduate. Watson forces us toquestion various long-cherished political and intellectual assumptions in his witty and conversational style. Is snobbery really such a bad thing? Have we ignored the links between socialism and genocide? He touches entertainingly upon subjects as diverse as literary theory (experimental fiction is often the last resort of those who have nothing to say), and the unoriginal conformism of teenage Marxists (incapable of actually reading Marx, as he is too boring). This is a work which will delight any reader seeking a uniquely personal perspective on the culture, history, and personalities of the twentieth century.",['Religion'],200.0,en,2013-03-28,

Hints and Guesses: William Gaddis's Fiction of Longing is the first scholarly work to discuss all four Gaddis novels. While not dismissing the inclination of many scholars to view Gaddis's fiction as postmodern, Christopher Knight moves critical response in another direction, toward a discussion of Gaddis's significance as a satirist and social critic. Knight investigates Gaddis's predominant thematic interests, including those of contemporary aesthetics, Flemish painting, forgery, corporate America, Third World politics, and the U.S. legal system. What Knight finds is an author not only acutely sensitive to post-war social realities but also one whose critique carries with it an implied utopian dimension.",['Literary Criticism'],268.0,en,1990,

['George A. Panichas'],Growing Wings to Overcome Gravity,"Writers of novels, plays, and poems use their imagination with an evident freedom; by contrast, makers of Christian doctrine seem to impose limits, reducing the open-ended meaning of images to exact concepts and summing up the loose ends of stories in one unified Story. But the author of this study sets out to show how images and stories in literature can actually help the theologian to make doctrinal statements, while at the same time careful theological thinking can assist the critical reading of literary texts. Such a dialogue is worked out in studies of the poetry, of William Blake and Gerard Manley Hopkins, and the novels of D. H. Lawrence, Iris Murdoch, and William Going. Here the tension between the freedom of imagination and the limits of doctrine is seen to be only a part of more far-reaching tensions of freedom in human life, which account for a sense of 'fallenness', and which a dialogue between literature and Christian doctrine can do much to illuminate. In all this, the relationship between imagination and revelation is never far from the center of the discussion.",['Literary Criticism'],340.0,en,1999,

Behind the tranquil facade; Dehra is home to a cast of colourful characters: from plucky old women to possible murderers. 'The Canal' is a joyful tribute to adolescent mischief and adult resolve; in which a group of roguish boys must face the consequences of antagonizing the much-feared Miss Gamla. 'Over the Wall' celebrates the resilience and hard-won dignity of a man ravaged by leprosy as he struggles to come to terms with his malady.

Whether we are accompanying Sita on her perilous journey down the angry river or Bisnu as he gets the better of a dangerous leopard, whether we delight in Binya's joy at owning her blue umbrella or are saddened by the fate of the last tiger, whether we laugh uproariously at the antics of the eccentric guests at the 'hotel' in Shamli, get involved in the adventures of the boys in Pipalnagar or plunge into the various goings-on in the 'backwater' of Fosterganj, we are always entertained, always charmed. All the stories unwind in an unhurried way, even those that are filled with death-defying thrills and spills, and it is this quality that enables us to sink into them and experience to its fullest the magic of the fiction that Ruskin Bond has spun out of the hills and small towns of India for over sixty years.",['Fiction'],250,en,2017-12,

It bounced on the ground, like a coconut. This was followed by the boy's arms, legs and body, all falling to the ground one after another. India is a land of many myths. Curiosity abounds in every corner, and at every turn, there's some sprinkling of mystery. Soothsayers with their prophecies and wise men with their wisdom co-exist with swindlers with their stratagems and conjurers with their charms, weaving illusions to appear as powerful as the many gods that this land worships. In The Great Indian Rope Trick, Ruskin Bond puts together a selection of stories that capture both the magical and the mundane. Witness peripatetic men casting their spells, know the legends of Binsar, or just rush off with Rusty into the arms of freedom. A world of wonder awaits.",,224,en,2021-02-05,

['Ruskin Bond'],Party Time In Mussoorie,"It is very kind of people to invite me to their parties, especially as I do not throw parties myself or invite anyone anywhere. At more than one party I have been known to throw things at people. In spite of this-or maybe because of it-I get invited to these affairs. There's nothing like being able to see the funny side of things in life. Whether it is a belt that decides to get hooked on to another passenger's bag or monkeys who visit and take refuge in the loo or even the omelettes that don't turn out exactly the way they were intended, Ruskin Bond brings alive each of these situations with wry humour and a generous dose of wit. Party Time in Mussoorie is as much fun to read as it is to attend any of the weird and wonderful parties Ruskin Bond describes in this collection.",['Literary Criticism'],144,en,2016-12,
['Ruskin Bond'],Lone Fox Dancing,"Over sixty years, for numerous readers--of all ages; in big cities, small towns and little hamlets--Ruskin Bond has been the best kind of companion. He has entertained, charmed and occasionally spooked us with his books and stories, and opened our eyes to the beauty of the everyday and the natural world. He has made us smile when our spirits are low, and steadied us when we've stumbled. Now, in this brilliantly readable autobiography--his book of books--one of India's greatest writers shows us the roots of everything he has written. He begins with a dream and a gentle haunting, before taking us to an idyllic childhood in Jamnagar by the Arabian Sea--where he composed his first poem--and New Delhi in the early 1940s--where he found material for his first short story. It was a brief period of happiness that ended with his parents' separation and the untimely death of his beloved father. A search for companionship and security, undercut by a fierce independence and a tendency for risk-taking, would inform every choice he made for the rest of his life. With effortless intimacy and candour, Bond recalls his boarding school days in Shimla and winter holidays in Dehradun, when he tried to come to terms with a sense of abandonment, made friends, discovered great books and found his true calling. Determined to be a writer, he spent four difficult years in England, from 1951 to 1955, and he writes poignantly of his loneliness there, even as he kept his promise to himself and produced a book--the classic novel of adolescence, The Room on the Roof. It was born of his longing for 'the atmosphere that was India'--the home he would return to even before the novel was published, taking a gamble that would prove to be the best decision he made. In the final, glorious section of the autobiography, he writes about losing his restlessness and settling down in the hills of Mussoorie, surrounded by generous trees, mist and sunshine, birdsong, elusive big cats, new friends and eccentrics--and a family that grew around him and made him its own. Full of anecdote, warmth and gentle wit; often deeply moving and always with a magnificent sense of time and place--and containing over fifty photographs, some of them never seen before--Lone Fox Dancing is a book of understated, enduring magic, like Ruskin Bond himself.",,320,en,2017-06-02,
